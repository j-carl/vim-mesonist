INTRODUCTION                                                        *mesonist*

Whereever you are in your project, a set of commands are available as a
gateway to meson.


COMMANDS                                                   *mesonist-commands*

                                                              *:MesonistSetup*
:MesonistSetup               Locates the meson root path with an upwards
                             search to find directory holding the meson.build
                             file with function project(...). Once found it
                             runs 'meson setup <buildir>' and modifies the
                             :make command to compile the project. The build
                             directory can be overwriten
                             by |g:mesonist_meson_builddir|.

                                                         *:MesonLocateRootDir*
:MesonLocateRootDir          Resets the meson root path and echoes it.
